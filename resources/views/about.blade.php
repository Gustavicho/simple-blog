            This is a project that I did TOTALLY alone, I can say it's my first try.
            Unlike others like Lara30d or pixel positions, these I did while watching a tutorial.

        <x-card title="About me" imgSrc="https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/026/638/cat.jpg">
            For a long time I only watched videos and videos on how to make websites, the famous hell tutorial.
            But I felt ashamed and here I am! trying to learn Laravel
